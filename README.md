# Sevens Card Game

Sevens is a card game for 3-8 people. This implementation is played on one device through a web app.

## Motivation

This is an implementation of the Sevens card game (also known as card dominoes) for the cmd-f 2020 hackathon. This inspiration for creating an online card game came from the countless times we forgot to bring a card deck on the ferry.
